# This file uses TOML format (https://toml.io)

# Can specify multiple directories

# Directories to exclude from scanning
# Can be absolute paths or folder names (will match any folder with that name)
# Examples:
#   - ".sync" - excludes any folder named ".sync"
#   - "D:/Photos/.thumbnails" - excludes this specific folder

# Processing mode: "full", "supplement", or "incremental"

# - supplement: Skip files that already exist in target
# - incremental: Only process files newer than newest in target (default)

# - year: Organize by year (YYYY/)
# - year-month: Organize by year and month (YYYY/MM/)
